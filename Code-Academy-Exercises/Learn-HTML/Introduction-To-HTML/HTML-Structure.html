<body>
  <h1>Hello World</h1>

  <div>
    <p>This paragraph is a child of the div element and a grandchild of the body element</p>
  </div>
</body>

<!--In this exercise I learned about HTML hierarchy and how elements nest in
a 'family tree' like fashion. For instance, above, the <p> element is a child
of the <div> element.-->
