<!DOCTYPE html>

<!-- In this exercise I learned how to setup an HTML document by including
the document type declaration <!DOCTYPE html>. The document type declaration
tells the browser what type of document the file is and what version of HTML
it's coded in. Including the document type  ensures the file is interpreted
correctly as versions change. Also, I learned that HTML files are saved with
a .html file extension.-->
