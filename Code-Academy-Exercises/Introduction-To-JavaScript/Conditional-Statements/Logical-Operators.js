/*To make more complex conditional statements, we can use logical operators. The three logical operators
are and &&, or ||, and not !. && creates a condition where both statements must
be true to evaluate to true, || is a condition where only one statement must
evaluste to true to return true, and ! reverses the boolean value given (!true
is false and vice versa).*/
