/*When JavaScript, or any other web language, is updated or undergoes syntax changes
there is a period of time when web browsers are incompatible with some of the
syntax changes and these changes may present security vulverabilities. Part of being
a developer is learning to deal with language updates. Two tools in helping with this is
caniuse.com and Babel. */
