/*The ES6 update for JavaScript made the language more like other object oriented
languages, thus attracting more developers to use it. It also requires less code to
achieve the same functionality (economy of code). The ES6 update also addresses bug
issues encountered in ES5. Since the changes were adopted early before browsers
could establish compatibility, ES6 was made backward compatible. This means that new
syntax can be mapped to old (ES5) syntax.*/
