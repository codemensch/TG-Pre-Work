// Use .toUpperCase() to log 'Codecademy' in all uppercase letters
console.log('Codecademy'.toUpperCase());

// Use a string method to log the following string without whitespace at the beginning and end of it.
console.log('    Remove whitespace   '.trim());

/*String instances also have methods associated with them like string properties.
To access string methods, just append the method to the string instance with
a dot operator ('hello'.toUpperCase()), Some methods take arguments, which are placed
 between the parenthesis ('hello'.startsWith('h').)*/
