/*In programming we want to be able to communicate more precisely and more easily
concepts and elements of a program. This can be difficult to do if we have to detail
every part of a program or debug code line by line. By writing functions we can abstract
or make parts of a program modular or more logical. Another way of establishing
abstraction or modular code is to use higher order functions, which take or return
functions as arguments or output instead of passing small bits of data.*/
