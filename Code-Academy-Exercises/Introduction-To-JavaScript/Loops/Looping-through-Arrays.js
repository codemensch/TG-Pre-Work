/*To loop through an array we first modify the stopping condition by making the
maximum number the length of the array. The easiest way to find the length of
an array is to use .length. Then we use bracket notation to reference each element
in the array by replacing the index number with our iterat variable, which will
update with every turn of the for loop.*/
