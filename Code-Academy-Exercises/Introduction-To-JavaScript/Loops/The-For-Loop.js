/*One type of loop is the for loop. The for loop has three parts: an initialization
statement where a variable is initialized, a stopping condition where the variable is checked,
and an iteration statement where the variable is updated if the stopping condition hasn't
been met. When the stopping condition has been met the loop stops.*/
