// The loop below loops from 0 to 3. Edit it to loop backwards from 3 to 0

/*To loop backwards, the counting variable is set to the highest number instead
of the lowest, the stopping condition is set to "greater than" instead of "less
than" and the iterator statement uses the minus itereation operator (--) instead
of ++.*/
